Believing the Universe to be static-neither expanding nor contracting-he added an extra term to his famous equations,  the \"cosmological constant\" term represented by the Greek letter lambda (Λ). With this added term,  his equations allowed for a \"static\" Universe.When Edwin Hubble\'s studies indicated the Universe was expanding,  Einstein called it \"the greatest blunder of my life.\" However,  this declaration may have been premature. Studies in the 1990\'s suggest the universe is not only expanding but doing so at an accelerating rate,  making the cosmological constant a subject of renewed interest among astrophysicists.",
